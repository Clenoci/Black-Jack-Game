Black Jack Instructions

When Black Jack opens you will be welcomed to the table by a friendly message 

Then you will be dealt two cards displayed on the screen.

From there you will choose to hit, and get another card or stay with the cards you currently have.(entering 1 or 0 resoectively)

Keep hitting until you feel you have a good chance to win or you bust and lose

If you stay with your current cards the dealer will then look at its cards and hit until it feels it has the best chance to win without risking busting

Once the Dealer finishes your hand value will be compared to the hand value of the dealer.

Whoever has the highest hand value without going over 21 wins

If the player recieves a card with a value 10 and an ace in their intitial hand they autmatically win with BLACKJACK and the game will end

If either the player or dealer goes over 21 they will bust, get the appropriate message saying they busted and the game will end

If both player and dealer have the same hand value, the game will be a tie, and pushed to the next round.

After the game is over the player will be prompted to play again or quit (choosing 1 or 0 respectively)

Each game a new deck will be created and reshuffled. 

Happy Gambling!
